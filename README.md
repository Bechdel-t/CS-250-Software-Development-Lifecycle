# Module 8 Journal

## 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with truly understanding what they want and what challenges they're trying to solve, usually through communication and research. Translating these insights into user stories helps because it frames requirements in a way that prioritizes the user's perspective, like saying, "As a user, I want X so I can achieve Y." This approach ensures the development process focuses on delivering meaningful value and keeps the team aligned toward meeting user goals efficiently. 

## 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Development starts with understanding the purpose behind what you're building, prioritizing user needs, and then designing solutions that are both scalable and efficient. For future work, I hope to incorporate Agile processes like iterative development, where progress is made in small, manageable chunks, and frameworks like Scrum@Scale of SAFe to streamline collaboration and adaptability. These approaches create a rhythm that allows for continous feedback and improvement, ensuring the final product truly meets its goals.

## 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member in software development means embracing collaboration, communication, and adaptability. It's about sharing ideas openly, respecting different perspectives, and contributing to collective problem solving. Good team members actively listen, give constructive feedback, and offer support where and when it's needed. They stay committed to delivering quality work while aligning with the team's goals. In an Agile environment, it's especially important to be flexible, value iterative progress, and take responsibility for your role in the workflow. Ultimately, it's about being reliable, cooperative, and focused on the success of the team as a whole.
